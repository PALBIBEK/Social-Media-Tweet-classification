This project classifies COVID-19-related tweets as fake or real news using the Constraint@AAAI-2021 dataset. A text preprocessing pipeline was developed to enhance sentence representation. Various models, including DNN, CNN, BERT, and machine learning algorithms, were implemented and fine-tuned for binary classification. The best model achieved 93% accuracy in detecting fake news.
